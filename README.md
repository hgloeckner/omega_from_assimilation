# README

This repo contains scripts to calculate the circle products from the IFS first guess, analysis, observation and the orcestra sondes that were assimilated by IFS.

One script prepares the data such that it clear which sondes belong to which circle and the ones that don't belong to any circle are dropped. 

The second script calculates the circle products for each, OBS, AN and FG as in the IFS dataset as well as for ORC which differs from the official BEACH dataset because it only uses the sondes that are assimilated by IFS.
